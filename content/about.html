<p>The plot <a href="/blog/2020-11-09-land-leased-for-garden/">leased from the town</a> is immediately to the rear of Emerald House and surrounds an historic grapevine, which we plan to revitalize as the centerpiece of the garden.</p>
<p>We will be working throughout the winter and spring to <a href="/contact">hear what people need</a>, <a href="/blog/2020-11-14-breaking-ground/">prepare the land</a>, bring water to the site, and erect fencing.</p>
<div id="current-goals" class="section level2">
<h2>Current Goals</h2>
<p>Our Goals are to honor the <a href="/history">historic legacy</a> of farming on the property by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cultivating a gardening community with a diversity of ages, races, genders, cultural backgrounds, socioeconomic means, and gardening experience.</li>
<li>Creating a learning environment for sharing skills and knowledge.</li>
<li>Having a positive impact on the local environment.</li>
<li>Being a catalyst for positive change in local food production in the garden and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p>To aid our planning to meet these goals we are <a href="/contact">seeking comment</a> from stakeholder groups and the public about how people would like to see this space used and how we can ensure access to participation from all residents in town.</p>
<p>We are at the early stages of planning and have lots of questions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of events or educational opportunities would people be interested in?</li>
<li>Do we want a series of individually gardened plots? Or are there shared resources we can create to benefit all?</li>
<li>How could the local schools be involved?</li>
<li>How might we serve the community in providing local, nutritionally-rich food to people in need?</li>
<li>Whats the fairest way to apportion out the land to interested growers?</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Once open, we expect to remain on this plot of land for two or three years while the town discusses the wider plan for the Emerald property. The town is looking to lease the house as a cultural site and is developing a master plan for the rest of the property to potentially include affordable housing, an inclusive playspace, and a larger community garden.</p>
