<blockquote>
<p>The Emerald family homestead on Davisville Road stands as one reminder of an extraordinary period in Falmouth’s history. The late 1800s introduced an important new element to the community. The Portuguese culture was admirable and the agricultural vision of the new immigrants was remarkable. A century after the first immigration their descendants are vital contributors to the life of the town. Now that the town has bought the Emerald property, we have an opportunity to insure that future generations understand and appreciate this period of history</p>
