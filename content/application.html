In addition we will have at least two raised beds for gardeners with limited mobility and at least one wheelchair accessible bed too.</p>
<p>Water will be available approximately every 20-30’ in the garden. The fence surrounding the garden will be 5’ high 1 inch Deerbuster hex fencing with 1’ buried for critter control. We will have at least two access gates, one of which will be wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p>Plots will be $25 for the season.
