We are delighted to announce that we've received $3000 in funding from the [Falmouth Fund](https://www.capecodfoundation.org/our-funds/falmouth-fund/), part of the [Cape Cod Foundation](https://www.capecodfoundation.org/our-funds/falmouth-fund/). We're going to use this money for vital infrastructure to set up the garden including fencing, irrigation, and the construction of accessible garden beds.

Thank you so much to the Falmouth Fund!
