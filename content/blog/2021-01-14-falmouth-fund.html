<p>We are delighted to announce that we’ve received $3000 in funding from the <a href="https://www.capecodfoundation.org/our-funds/falmouth-fund/">Falmouth Fund</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.capecodfoundation.org/our-funds/falmouth-fund/">Cape Cod Foundation</a>. We’re going to use this money for vital infrastructure to set up the garden including fencing, irrigation, and the construction of accessible garden beds.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to the Falmouth Fund!</p>
