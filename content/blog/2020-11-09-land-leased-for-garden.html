<p>At their meeting on Nov 9th, the Falmouth Selectboard unanimously approved a lease for Farming Falmouth to establish a community garden on the historic Emerald House property at 67 Davisville Road in East Falmouth. The lease is for a 5633 square foot space immediately to the rear of the house, enough space to accommodate 30 gardeners on 10 foot by 10 foot plots.</p>
<p>The next steps are to form a garden committee and start preparing the land and community for the garden to open in spring 2020.</p>
