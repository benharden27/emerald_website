<p>Wow, what an amazing response! Weâ€™re received so many more applications for plots than we were expecting - really shows how much demand there is for space to grow in our community.</p>
<p>The committee is currently working to assign plots based on a lottery system and we will let successful applicants know if they have been successful by April 1.</p>
