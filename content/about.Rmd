The Community Garden opened in May 2021 on a 6000 sq ft plot at the Historic Emerald House property on Davisville Road, East Falmouth.

The garden is Falmouth's second community garden, following on from the success of the [Marina F. Andrews Community Garden](https://www.falmouthcommunitygarden.org/) at Tony Andrew's Farm. The plot [leased from the town](/blog/2020-11-09-land-leased-for-garden/) for our garden is immediately to the rear of Emerald House and surrounds an historic grapevine, which has been revitalized as the centerpiece of the garden.
