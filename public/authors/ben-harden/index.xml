      <description>We have received a great number of comments and sign-ups for more information. Looking like nearly 40 folks interested in helping out and being involved and more are signing up daily - thanks to everyone who took the time to let us know their ideas. It’s an exciting time to see such support and interest.
The comments covered a wide range: we’ve got experienced master gardeners looking for a niche and we’ve got first-time-gardeners just keen to get started.</description>

      <description>We are delighted to announce that we’ve received $3000 in funding from the Falmouth Fund, part of the Cape Cod Foundation. We’re going to use this money for vital infrastructure to set up the garden including fencing, irrigation, and the construction of accessible garden beds.
Thank you so much to the Falmouth Fund!</description>

      <description>I will argue that every scrap of biological diversity is priceless, to be learned and cherished, and never to be surrendered without a struggle.

Leeks. In the ground.
 I have a variety of leek in my home garden that came about through my incompetence as a gardener. Or possibly due to being sleep-deprived from becoming a new father. Either way, it came about by chance.</description>

 The snow from last weeks storm was still on the ground when the committee met at Emerald House on Saturday. Before the snow had arrived, the the winter rye ground cover crop had germinated and tiny blades could be seen across the plot.</description>

 Another rich fall day and another opportunity for the committee to meet outdoors. This time, we were at the Marina F Andrews Community Garden down Berry Patch Lane at Tony Andrews Farm.
Again, Dick Pooley was our guide. The committee had decided that a good place to start our planning was to learn more about this community garden.</description>

 Today we broke ground on the Emerald Community Garden.
It was a warm day. Light sweater weather. One of those fall days where the sun seems to refuse to accept it’s winter role as a supporting character. We assembled on the grass behind Emerald House. Some with a long history with the property and others, like me, coming here for the first time. Some who will act in a supporting role from organizations like Farming Falmouth and the East Falmough Village Association and others looking to form the committee that will bring the garden into existence from this point forward.</description>
